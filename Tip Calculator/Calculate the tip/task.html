    You're almost there! In the final stage of the project,
    you need to take the user input data and perform the calculations.
    To determine the tip amount, take the overall bill value,
    multiply the number by the tip percentage, and divide it by 100.
    Output the tip amount with two digits in the fraction part.

    Using the event listeners from the previous stage,
    update the tip calculation result in the <code class="java">TextView</code> each time the user changes
    the bill value or tip percentage.

    Show the calculation result in the format 
    <code class="java">Tip amount: &lt;V&gt;$</code>, where<code class="java">&lt;V&gt;</code> 
    is the calculated tip amount formatted always with two decimals.
